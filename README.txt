# Genome-Scale Metabolic model of _Staphylococcus epidermidis_ RP62A
# Teresa DÃ­az Calvo, 2020;

	# Genome-Scale Metabolic modelling was applied to the study of the human pathogen S. epidermis. GSM models were constructed and analysed in order to explore the metabolism of cells living in the human joints. Results allowed identification of optimal routes for production of ATP and biofilm components.

Model: GSM models in .spy file format
    Sepi.spy: GSM in ScrumPy file format
